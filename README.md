# Terms of Service

The rsa.tf community is actively working to be a welcoming and respectful community, and we want to ensure that doesn't change as we grow and evolve.

To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to:

* be friendly and patient
* be considerate
* be welcoming
* be respectful
* be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others
* when we disagree, try to understand why

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended: a guide to make it easier to communicate and participate in the community.

This applies to all spaces managed by the rsa.tf organisation. Including (but not limited to) online chat during gameplay on rsa.tf servers, rsa.tf IRL events, and any other forums created by the organisation that the community uses for communication.

Violations outside these spaces may, in rare cases, affect an individual's ability to participate within them when the conduct amounts to an egregious violation of the terms.

## Violations

Behaviour rsa.tf will not tolerate includes, but is not limited to:

* cheating/collusion/match-fixing
* ongoing trash-talk (whether written or spoken)
* unsportsmanlike behaviour
* inciting or provoking another player
* doing anything illegal
* threatening and/or abusive talk or behaviour
* (c)overtly harassing other players
* defamatory, sexually-charged, vulgar, obscene, hateful, racially-charged, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable language (whether written or spoken) toward another player
* names and nicks containing (c)overtly defamatory, sexually-charged, vulgar, obscene, hateful, racially-charged, ethnically, religious, or otherwise objectionable content
* insulting another player’s culture or religion
* distributing real world information about another player without their consent

These rules are not typically contravened, but when they are, the type and degree of action taken is judged on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the rsa.tf organisation.

We weigh the type of violation, whether you are a repeat offender, and other factors.

You should understand the following:

* Certain minor violations will result in a warning or temporary ban.
* More serious violations will result in a permanent ban.
* If you have multiple accounts, we reserve the right to take action against all of your accounts for any single or multiple violations.
* The account holder is responsible for all violations that occur on that person’s account. So, never give access to your Discord/Steam/etc accounts to another person.
* If you violate these rules while participating in an rsa.tf event you may be sanctioned, or expelled from the event, at the discretion of the event organisers.

## Reports and Enquiries

If you believe someone is violating the terms of service, just have some questions, or are appealing a previous ruling on a violation, please feel free to contact anyone with the @admin role on [Discord](https://rsa.tf/discord).
